Data introdution:
The Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) with GWR, 1998-2016 data set utilizes NASA’s MODIS, MISR, and SeaWIFS Optical Aerosol Depth (AOD) data to produce a collection of 18 gridded data files for annual concentration (micrograms per cubic meter) of ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) – dust and sea-salt removed – one for each year during 1998-2016, at a spatial resolution of 0.01degrees (i.e., grid cells 1.1 km on a side at the equator). The annual estimates were generated following a geographically weighted regression technique (see van Donkelaar et al., 2016). The grids were developed from the ASCII data files for each year in ArcGIS.
